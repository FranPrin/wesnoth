    description= _ "Problem: [hose horsemen who are not skilled enough to join the ranks of the Sunderers or quick enough with a bow for the Swiftriders] sounds very degrading. As if it's the worst part of the Dunefolk army. Considering that the raider now actually is faster then the swift rider, the new concept with the melee fire and chaotic alignment allows the unit to serve a greater purpose. What if, instead of being just a simple raiding unit with few tactical purpose in warfare, it could be one that focuses on ambush enemy camps at night and setting tents and provisions on fire with their torches. The Marauder would follow that concept. 
    
    Those horsemen who are not skilled enough to join the ranks of the Sunderers or quick enough with a bow for the Swiftriders are instead placed with the Raiders. Far from being a sign of failure, the Raiders were created as a mounted counterpart to the Explorers, supporting the foot troops with mace or bow as needed. Raiders are often used to draw enemies into a position where they will be surrounded and crushed by Sunderers."
