    The frontlines of battle are the anvil on which inexperienced warriors are forged into Swordsmen of considerable ability. Swordsmen, through their combination of lifelong training and frontline experience, come to view their swords not as tools, but as extensions of their body. This familiarity with the blade is plain to see when one watches the Swordsman in combat, and sees the unerring precision with which he lands blows, against even the most fleet-footed of foes. A contingent of experienced Swordsmen represents, therefore, a potent shock force who can crack even the sternest of defences.

    Problems: [adding a powerful shield bash to knock back] no longer applies for this unit as the slow special was removed as was the entire shield attack. Instead the focus should be on the skill with blades as he weilds two different blades - one for strong attacks, the other for precise hits.
    
    Armed with their sword and shield, Swordsman are warriors of some renown among the Dunefolk armies. They have further refined their combat arts, adding a powerful shield bash to knock back unsuspecting enemies.
