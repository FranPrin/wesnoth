           For the most renown of Dunefolk swordsmen, the honorific title Blademaster is the highest of all accolades. To earn such a title is to bring great honour upon oneself and oneâ€™s line, and to be recognised among the Dunefolk as a fearsome warrior. A Blademaster in combat is a sight to see. In an open field, the Blademaster strikes with a speed and ferocity that is unmatched among the Dunefolk soldiery; while fighting in constrained spaces, however, the Blademaster can land devastating blows with alarming accuracy.

           Problem: [Blademasters are the leaders among the Dunefolk's ranks]. With the new Lv3 Dune Emir , now called Warmaster, it is confusing as the Warmaster actually has leadership abilities. Considerable to just move this sentece from the Lv3 Bladesmaster to the Lv3 Warmaster.
           
           Armed with their sword and shield, Swordsman are warriors of some renown among the Dunefolk armies. They have further refined their combat arts, adding a powerful shield bash to knock back unsuspecting enemies. Though few in number, their presence can be decisive in dislodging even the most hardened redoubt."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MARKSMAN}
