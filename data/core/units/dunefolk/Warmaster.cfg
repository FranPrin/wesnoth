    description=" Description by Tom_Of_Wesnoth

    A Warmaster is said to be the veteran of a thousand battles. Such statements are, of course, hyperbolic, but there is no doubt that any leader who earns the title of Warmaster has realms of experience, and has turned the tide of countless battles. In battle, the Warmaster is a talented warrior who strikes with speed and intensity. However, his real expertise comes in his ability as a leader. A speech by a Warmaster will lift the spirits of even the most cynical, embolden even the most cautious, and enlighten even the most experienced of warriors.

    They have proven their worth in many battles and can lead nearby units. While they are somewhat less skilled than their peers in combat, their tactical abilities can shift the tide of battles and lead their troops to victory."{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_LEADERSHIP}
