    description= _ "Alternate Version by Tom_Of_Wesnoth:

    The Soldier forms the core of any Dunefolk formation. Traditionally hailing from the bustling cities of the Dunefolk, or from land-owning families on the fertile riverbanks, most Soldiers are practised in swordplay even before their enrolment and formal training. This training, along with their high-quality arms and armour, gives rise to potent warriors. Though lacking in mobility, Soldiers are respected for their prowess in storming fortifications, and for their # resistance against enemy advances. The sight of the sunlight dancing across the shields of a formation of Soldiers is beautiful to behold, yet alarming for those tasked with fighting them.
    
    DEFAULT

    The Soldier forms the backbone of any Dunefolk foot advance. Many come from noble or military families, and have spent most of their lives training their craft. Given their intense focus on swordplay, they are often sent against fortified enemy positions to create a breach for the remaining troops to exploit. The sight of Soldiers on the march, shields high, has caused many a defender to worry about the strength of their walls."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MARKSMAN}
