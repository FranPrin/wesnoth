    While the prestige goes to the master swordsmen of the Dunefolk, some soldiers opt to trade in their sword, and instead fulfil the vital duties of the Spearguard. Clad in fine armour and carrying long, razor-sharp spears, the Spearguard are a formidable sight.The Spearguard are best suited to holding defensible terrain against enemy advances. The length of their spears allows them keep their enemies at bay, and to get the first blow in against any foolish enough to charge them. Those foes that do close the distance quickly find that the Spearguard are able and willing to use their shields as bludgeons.

    Although the Dunefolk armies are known for their astonishing mobility and fierce attack, they can be able defenders. Spearguard excel at holding their ground, keeping opponents at bay with long, razor sharp spears. Their preferred strategy is to gradually wear down enemies, until they can be defeated in a vicious counter stroke."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_FIRSTSTRIKE}
