    The Captain is the centre of any Dunefolk platoon. Captains choose themselves, as much as they are chosen, distinguishing themselves on the battlefield by taking initiative and inspiring their cohorts, and such leadership rarely goes unrewarded. Captains are not so proficient with the blade as the renown swordsmen. Instead, their ability lies in their ability to give rousing speeches and to bark orders â€“ and so, to bring out the best of those under their command. That is not to say, however, that they do not lead by example. A good Captain fights without fear even through the darkest of nights.
