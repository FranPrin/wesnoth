    Dune Skirmishers are recruited mostly form people who were brought up on deserts, running and playing between dunes. Their bodies are used to walking long distances and can endure harsh conditions of desert, thus to that they don't need to spend as much time training their bodies, so they can focus on agility and avoiding enemies without extending training process. During battles they usually stick close to other units and work with them, cutting off escape routes and attacking form places that are unreachable for other units.They are great tool in hands of experienced leader but not every leader will use them carefully enough which often leads to their quick demise."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}
