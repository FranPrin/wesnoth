    For young Naga of the southern tribes, proving oneself in combat is the ritual by which one enters adulthood. In times of war, this provides the Naga tribes with large numbers of Slashers - warriors who lack in experience, but make up for that with enthusiasm, agility, and agression. During times of peace, many Slashers become sellswords, selling their services to Dunefolk, and serving as merchant escorts or privateers. Slashers are most known for the two daggers that they traditionally carry, short and wickedly jagged blades that are deadly in the hands of an agile Naga. However, Slashers are equally comfortable operating as archers, using their mobility to keep their distance as they pepper their foes with arrows.

    The dune Nagas opposed to the Northerner Nagas could function as trusted mercenaries which help the Dunefolk secure trading routes for ship and support in naval battles and anything else that could relate to naval warfare or water generally. The Dunefolk, possibly known for being wealthy, surely can afford the needs of such sell-sword Nagas.

    In this case, the Naga Slasher could be a unit that is considered like a sell-sword to the Dunefolk Empire.
