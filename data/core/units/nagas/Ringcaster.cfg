    The blade ring - or chakram, as it is known to the Naga - is the signature weapon of the southern Naga, and of their renowned Ringcasters. The blade ring carries some cultural significance for the Naga - to be granted blade rings is a great honour, reserved for experienced warriors who have demonstrated their worth to their tribe. The blade ring is a deadly weapon when in the right hands, those few outside of the ranks of the Ringcasters can claim to have any mastery of the weapon. In a melee, the blade ring an be used as a cutting weapon, however it is a distance that that weapon is used to its full potential - a practicsed Ringcaster knows to spin the ring around his index finger, before launching it through the air with a deft flick of the wrist.

    As to the Ringcaster and Zephyr, they could be renegade sell swords who still work on paid duties but settled down in the more tribe-ish parts of the DF lands and do more odd jobs for local villagers (renegade opposed to the life of sell-swords).
